\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Understanding employee sentiment has become increasingly critical in today's competitive job market. Organizations worldwide recognize that employee satisfaction directly correlates with productivity, retention, and overall company performance. Traditional methods of gauging employee sentiment, such as internal surveys, often suffer from response bias and limited honesty. In contrast, anonymous online review platforms provide authentic, unfiltered feedback from current and former employees.

AmbitionBox, founded in 2014, has emerged as India's premier platform for company reviews, hosting millions of reviews from employees across thousands of organizations. The platform allows employees to share their experiences, rating companies on various parameters and providing detailed textual feedback on what they like and dislike about their workplaces.

\subsection{Research Objectives}

This study aims to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a robust automated data collection pipeline for employee reviews
    \item Create a comprehensive text preprocessing framework
    \item Extract meaningful features including sentiment scores, linguistic patterns, and domain-specific keywords
    \item Identify temporal trends in employee sentiment
    \item Discover distinctive vocabulary differentiating positive and negative experiences
    \item Generate actionable insights for understanding workplace satisfaction factors
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}

Our analysis focuses on textual reviews and numerical ratings, excluding other platform features such as salary data and interview experiences. Industry classification has been incorporated through cross-referencing company data with industry mappings to enable comprehensive sector-level analysis.

\section{Data Source and Collection}

\subsection{About AmbitionBox}

AmbitionBox is an Indian online platform that provides company reviews, salary insights, and interview experiences. Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Anonymous employee reviews with structured feedback
    \item Overall ratings on a 1-5 star scale
    \item Separate sections for ``likes'' (positive aspects) and ``dislikes'' (negative aspects)
    \item Review dates enabling temporal analysis
    \item Coverage of companies across all major Indian industries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Scraping Architecture}

We developed a comprehensive web scraping system using Python and Selenium WebDriver. The scraper implements a multi-layered extraction approach:

\subsubsection{Browser Automation}
The Chrome WebDriver was configured with headless mode capabilities for efficient server-side execution. Key configurations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User-agent spoofing to mimic legitimate browser requests
    \item JavaScript execution enabled for dynamic content rendering
    \item Configurable wait times (default: 10 seconds) for page loads
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Content Extraction Strategy}
Each company page required multiple processing steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the company's review page
    \item Handle lazy-loaded content through incremental scrolling
    \item Click ``Load More'' buttons to reveal additional reviews
    \item Expand truncated review text using ``Read More'' links
    \item Extract review elements using CSS selectors and XPath queries
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Rating-Review Matching Algorithm}
A sophisticated algorithm matches ratings to their corresponding review text based on vertical position (y-coordinate) on the page, ensuring accurate pairing of quantitative ratings with qualitative text.

\subsection{Data Consolidation Pipeline}

The scraping process was distributed across multiple team members and sessions, producing eight separate CSV files totaling approximately 44 MB of raw data. The consolidation script merged these sources:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Raw Data Sources}
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}r}
\toprule
\textbf{Source File} & \textbf{Size (MB)} \\
\midrule
ambitionbox\_likes\_dislikes\_with\_overall.csv & 4.0 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_2.csv & 5.3 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_uday.csv & 4.9 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_otherhalf\_shreyansh.csv & 8.0 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_shreyansh.csv & 9.1 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_new2\_sam.csv & 4.4 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_new\_sam.csv & 2.1 \\
ambitionbox\_..\_new3\_sam.csv & 3.0 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total Raw Data} & \textbf{40.8} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Data quality controls during consolidation included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conversion of ratings to numeric format with error handling
    \item Removal of fractional ratings (keeping only integer 1-5 scale)
    \item Filtering of records with missing or invalid review dates
    \item Deduplication based on all columns
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Description}

\subsection{Data Schema}

The cleaned dataset (\texttt{final\_cleaned.csv}) contains the following fields:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Dataset Schema}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.2cm}p{1.2cm}p{3.8cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Column} & \textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
company & String & Company name \\
page & Integer & Source page number \\
review\_index\_on\_page & Integer & Position on page \\
like\_text & String & Positive feedback text \\
dislike\_text & String & Negative feedback text \\
overall\_rating & Float & Rating (1.0-5.0) \\
review\_date & String & Date of review \\
review\_year & Integer & Extracted year \\
review\_url & String & Source URL \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Dataset Statistics}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comprehensive Dataset Statistics}
\begin{tabular}{lr}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Total Reviews & 199,543 \\
Unique Companies & 969 \\
Average Reviews per Company & 206 \\
Median Reviews per Company & 127 \\
Max Reviews for a Company & 2,847 \\
Min Reviews for a Company & 10 \\
\midrule
Mean Overall Rating & 3.81 \\
Median Overall Rating & 4.0 \\
Mode Overall Rating & 5.0 \\
Standard Deviation & 1.23 \\
\midrule
Temporal Range & 2015--2025 \\
Peak Year (by volume) & 2024 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Rating Distribution Analysis}

The distribution of overall ratings exhibits a notable positive skew:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Rating Distribution}
\begin{tabular}{crr}
\toprule
\textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
\midrule
1 star & 18,234 & 9.1\% \\
2 stars & 14,567 & 7.3\% \\
3 stars & 32,891 & 16.5\% \\
4 stars & 48,723 & 24.4\% \\
5 stars & 85,128 & 42.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This positive skew suggests self-selection bias---employees with extremely positive or negative experiences are more likely to leave reviews, with satisfied employees slightly more motivated to share feedback.

\section{Data Preprocessing}

\subsection{Text Cleaning Pipeline}

The preprocessing module implements a comprehensive text normalization pipeline:

\subsubsection{Regular Expression-Based Cleaning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Case Normalization}: \texttt{text.lower()} converts all characters to lowercase, ensuring consistent token matching
    \item \textbf{URL Removal}: Pattern \texttt{r'http\textbackslash S+|www\textbackslash S+|https\textbackslash S+'} removes web links
    \item \textbf{Email Filtering}: Pattern \texttt{r'\textbackslash S+@\textbackslash S+'} strips email addresses
    \item \textbf{Non-Alphabetic Removal}: Pattern \texttt{r'[\^{}a-z\textbackslash s]'} retains only English letters and whitespace
    \item \textbf{Whitespace Normalization}: \texttt{' '.join(text.split())} collapses multiple spaces
    \item \textbf{Short Token Removal}: Filters tokens with length $\leq 1$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Quality Thresholds}
Reviews failing quality criteria were excluded:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimum text length: 2 characters for both likes and dislikes
    \item Minimum company review count: 10 reviews per company
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Temporal Feature Extraction}

Review year was extracted from the date string using regex: \texttt{r'(\textbackslash d\{4\})'}, enabling temporal trend analysis across the 2015--2025 period.

\section{Feature Engineering}

\subsection{Advanced NLP Preprocessing}

The feature extraction module applies additional NLP techniques:

\subsubsection{Contraction Expansion}
A dictionary of 30+ common English contractions maps shortened forms to their full equivalents (e.g., ``don't'' $\rightarrow$ ``do not'', ``won't'' $\rightarrow$ ``will not'').

\subsubsection{Stop Word Removal}
NLTK's English stopword list (179 words) removes common function words that add noise to analysis.

\subsubsection{Lemmatization}
WordNetLemmatizer reduces words to their dictionary base forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``working'' $\rightarrow$ ``work''
    \item ``employees'' $\rightarrow$ ``employee''
    \item ``better'' $\rightarrow$ ``good''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sentiment Feature Extraction}

TextBlob library extracts two sentiment dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Polarity} ($-1$ to $+1$): Measures sentiment orientation. Negative values indicate negative sentiment; positive values indicate positive sentiment.
    \item \textbf{Subjectivity} ($0$ to $1$): Measures opinion intensity. Values near 0 indicate objective, factual statements; values near 1 indicate highly subjective opinions.
\end{itemize}

A derived feature, \textbf{Sentiment Difference}, computes the gap between like polarity and dislike polarity, quantifying the consistency of a reviewer's overall sentiment.

\subsection{Domain-Specific Keyword Features}

Seven keyword categories were defined based on common workplace themes:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Keyword Categories}
\begin{tabular}{p{1.8cm}p{5.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Keywords} \\
\midrule
Salary & salary, pay, compensation, bonus, increment, hike, package \\
Growth & growth, learning, skill, training, development, career, promotion \\
Culture & culture, environment, atmosphere, team, management, leadership \\
Work-Life & work life balance, timing, hours, flexible, leaves, holiday \\
Security & security, stable, permanent, job security, layoff \\
Stress & stress, pressure, workload, overwork, burden, exhausted \\
Negative & bad, worst, poor, terrible, horrible, pathetic \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Company-Level Aggregations}

Statistical aggregations computed per company include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean, standard deviation, and count of overall ratings
    \item Mean and standard deviation of sentiment polarity (likes and dislikes)
    \item Average word counts for review text
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TF-IDF Vectorization}

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) converts text to numerical features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Max Features}: 100 (top terms by TF-IDF score)
    \item \textbf{N-gram Range}: (1, 2) capturing unigrams and bigrams
    \item \textbf{Document Frequency Bounds}: min\_df=100, max\_df=0.8
\end{itemize}

The resulting feature matrix contains 100 TF-IDF columns representing the most informative terms across the corpus.

\subsection{Feature-Enriched Dataset}

The final dataset (\texttt{data\_with\_features.csv}) contains 147 columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 9 original columns
    \item 5 sentiment features
    \item 5 text length features
    \item 14 keyword frequency features (7 categories $\times$ 2 text types)
    \item 14 company aggregate features
    \item 100 TF-IDF features
\end{itemize}

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{Text Length Analysis}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Text Length Comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Likes} & \textbf{Dislikes} \\
\midrule
Mean Characters & 51 & 43 \\
Median Characters & 42 & 35 \\
Mean Words & 8.3 & 7.3 \\
Median Words & 7 & 6 \\
Max Words & 487 & 412 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The 18.6\% longer average length of ``likes'' text suggests employees invest more effort articulating positive aspects or that positive experiences offer more specific details to share.

\subsection{Temporal Patterns}

Review volume has grown substantially over the years, with 2024 showing the highest activity. Average ratings have remained stable (3.7--3.9) across the temporal range, indicating consistent overall sentiment despite increased platform adoption.

\section{Visualization and Key Findings}

The analysis module generates six comprehensive visualizations:

\subsection{Rating Distribution (Bar Plot)}

The rating distribution visualization confirms the positive skew, with 67.1\% of reviews rating companies 4 or 5 stars. This finding aligns with research on online review platforms where satisfied customers exhibit higher review propensity.
